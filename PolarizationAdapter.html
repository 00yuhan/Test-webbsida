                        alt="Image of the Flashligth that the products holds on to.">
                    <p>While there are many flashlights available, this design specifically fits a Meke Macro Ring Lite.
                        Consequently, all shapes and dimensions are based on its exact measurements.</p>
                    <br>
                    <img id="magnetic" src="bilder/Dental polarization bilder/magnetics.webp"
                        alt="early itterations, showcasing how they used magnets as a mechanism."
                        class="fullWidthImage">


                    <p><br>Many existing solutions use magnets because they offer several benefits: they snap quickly
                        into
                        place and are easy to remove, making them very user-friendly. In my initial designs, the first
                        iterations used magnets and worked quite well.

                        However, this meant the magnets had to be purchased and installed, adding extra steps to the
                        manufacturing process. Furthermore, they didn't feel secure enough for my taste. There had to be
                        another way. <br><br>
                    </p>

                    <img id="friction" class="paddingUnderImage" src="bilder/Dental polarization bilder/friction.webp"
                        alt="">
                    <p>
                        Instead of magnets, I experimented with small 'nooks' to hold the end part securely. While this
                        solution worked to keep the component latched, it wasn't nearly as quick as the magnetic
                        version.
                        This made switching between polarized and non-polarized light a challenge.
                        To solve this, I tried to make the entire product removable, while matching the efficiency of
                        magnets.

                        <br>The side slots made it possible to secure the product to the ring light very quickly and
                        smoothly. However, it was not easily removable, unless you had tiny fingers or long sturdy
                        nails. To
                        counter this, I designed and tested several button shapes. Ultimately, although the buttons made
                        the
                        mount easier to remove, the process still wasn't efficient enough. So back to the drawing
                        board!<br><br>

                    <p>
                        <br>The solution was right under my nose all along: the same mechanism used for lens hoods. This
                        approach makes mounting and dismounting the end cap quick and efficient. It is a user-friendly
                        system that requires no external partsm, like magnets, and no extra installation steps. While it
                        is
                        admittedly not quite as lightning-fast as magnets, the added security and manufacturing
                        simplicity
                        outweigh that single trade-off, and with futher itterations it might become even more efficient
                        ;).<br><br>

                    <br>
                    <p>Working with polarized sheets was a major challenge. Standard films are easy to source and cut,
                        but
                        they are too flimsy and warp easily, affecting image quality. Since sturdier materials like
                        polarized acrylic aren't readily available to consumers, and glass is too difficult to cut, I
                        tried
                        laminating a polarizing film onto an acrylic sheet. However, this introduced new issues: trapped
                        air
                        bubbles and the difficulty of precision cutting with a coping saw. Ideally, I'd use pre-cut,
                        professional polarized glass.</p>
                    <br>

                    <div class="gridEval">
                        <img id="lyftaupp" src="bilder/Dental polarization bilder/laser cutting.webp"
                            alt="Exploded view of adapter" class="fullWidthImage">
                        <img src="bilder/Dental polarization bilder/lasercutParts.webp" alt="Exploded view of adapter"

                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Ultimately, the solution involved carefully applying the polarized sheet onto a cleaned,
                        dust-free
                        acrylic base. Once applied, a laser cutter was used to achieve a perfect shape. This method
                        ensured
                        minimal air bubbles and a snug fit within the 3D-printed component, resulting in the highest
                        possible quality.
                        <br><br>
                        Special attention was paid to the notch in the circular center; this feature allows for a
                        90-degree
                        rotation to achieve the cross-polarization effect. If this alignment is off, the filtration
                        efficiency drops significantly.
                        <br><br>
                        This was the most difficult phase of the project because precision was critical to its success.
                        Using a manual saw made it nearly impossible to maintain the tight tolerances required for a
                        proper
                        fit and the correct angle. The laser cutter eliminated these issues. Although I was reluctant to
                        rely on it because it is a "bottleneck" that neither I nor the average user can easily access,
                        the
                        results were undeniable. In the end, the laser cutter provided a level of precision that would
                        be
                        very difficult to achieve with a handsaw or even a mill.

                        This project has taken much longer than I anticipated, with many more iterations than expected,
                        and
                        it is still ongoing. I know there are many parts I can still improve, simplify, change, or
                        entirely
                        rethink; it is a living project. However, it works and it's a great tool, even if it is a bit
                        over-engineered (hehe). Through this, I have gained invaluable experience and learned plenty of
                        tricks regarding 3D modeling, 3D printing, and general engineering problem-solving. It was time
                        and
                        effort well spent!
